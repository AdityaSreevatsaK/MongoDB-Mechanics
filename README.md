## <i>Model. Query. Optimise NoSQL.</i>

Dive into the core mechanics of MongoDB through Python-based implementations using PyMongo. This repository offers 
hands-on examples covering CRUD operations, schema design strategies, indexing techniques, and the powerful aggregation 
framework. From simple queries to optimised NoSQL architectures, this is your toolkit for mastering document-based 
databases in practical contexts.
